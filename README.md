# ElGamal Signature Scheme
# Overview
This repository contains implementations of cryptographic algorithms:

1- Unforgeability under Chosen Message Attack (UF-CMA)

Implementation of a cryptographic scheme designed to withstand UF-CMA attacks.

2- ElGamal Signature Scheme

A complete implementation of the ElGamal signature scheme from scratch.

# Implementation Details
## Unforgeability under Chosen Message Attack (UF-CMA)
In UF-CMA, an adversary can select messages of her choice and request corresponding tags or MACs from the scheme's oracle. This enables the adversary to test the system's vulnerability and attempt to forge tags for unauthorized messages. 

## ElGamal Signature Scheme
The ElGamal signature scheme is a digital signature scheme based on the ElGamal encryption algorithm. It provides a method for creating and verifying digital signatures that offer security properties like unforgeability and non-repudiation.
